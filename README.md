# Class demo Calculator part 1: Functions

In class demo from 10/10
You will create functions to perform mathematical calculations. This will be used in tomorrows assignment where you will create a calculator interface with clickable buttons.

The functions in this lab we can test in the console.

#### Get started:
- create a new repo on Github
- name the repo TKH-calculator, add README.md file
- clone the repo into your week5 folder on your computer
- open the TKH-calculator folder in VS code 
- create a new file inside TKH-calculator named calculator.js

#### Instructions:
- open the calculator.js file. you will write all your code for this lab inside this file 
- create functions for each operation: add, subtract, multiply and divide
